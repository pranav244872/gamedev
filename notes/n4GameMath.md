2D Games
- Every game's graphics are drawn to a screen
- Screens are a plan, 2D
- Screens are made of small, discrete elements: pixels
- Pixels are (usually) square and have RGB elements
- In modern games, we specify the color of an object(pixel, shape, etc) in a specific Color Spacce of the game/ display
- RGB, RGBA, CMYK, Grayscale, Monochrome etc
- RGBA is most common modern color space
    - Red, Green , Blue, Alpha - Transperancy

2D positions
- System display: pixel grid
- Grid is in two dimensions(x, y)
- We can use a Euclidean (x,y) plane to visualie individual positions 
- Each integer position is a display pixel
- Note: Displays can be resized/ full screen, so pixels can appear larger
- Most APIs have(0,0) in top left
